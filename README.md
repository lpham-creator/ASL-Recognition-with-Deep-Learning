# ASL-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning

## Data
The dataset comes from DataCamp, [here](https://app.datacamp.com/)

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- scikit-learn (PCA, KMeans, StandardScaler)

## Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Since the data is already clean, luckily, we did not have to do data preprocessing

## Techniques
- One-hot encoding for 3 layers of letters
- Convolutional neural network in Keras
- Evaluate model's accuracy using a built-in function
